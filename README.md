# covid_sql_explore_script
SQL script of exploring Covid-related data
This project is the longest one I have done yet.  Once again, it is a tutorial given by Alex the Analyst.
There are so many other questions I could have tried answering with the particular dataset involved.  There was so much data to explore.
What we do have here are a lot of sums, conversions (mostly varchar to int), and joins.
I liked using CTEs and temp tables.  I see myself using these quite a bit in my future.
